# EmbASP

EmbASP is a framework for the integration of Answer Set Programming in external systems for generic applications, conceived in order to help developers at designing and implementing complex reasoning tasks by means of ASP solvers on different platforms.
The framework is provided with APIs for the use of two state-of-the-art ASP systems, namely DLV and clingo, respectively, on Android mobile context and on desktop platform; however, it has been designed to be easily extensible and adaptable to different solvers and platforms.
