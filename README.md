# ANDLV

EmbASP is a general framework for embedding ASP in complex systems, and in particular within applications for mobile devices. EmbASP is conceived in order to help developers at designing and implementing complex reasoning tasks in a straightforward way by means of ASP solvers. The framework is provided with DLV as default solver, which is the first ASP system which is undergoing an industrial exploitation; however, it is easy to extend it with different solvers through plain Java Object-Oriented programming.
