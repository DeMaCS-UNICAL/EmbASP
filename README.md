# EmbASP

EmbASP is a framework for the integration of Logic Programming in external systems for generic applications, conceived in order to help developers at designing and implementing complex reasoning tasks by means of logic-based solvers on different platforms.

We currently provide 2 implementations (one in [Java](https://www.java.com) and one in [Python](https://www.python.org)) and ready-made libraries for the embedding of the _ASP (Answer Set Programming)_ solvers [DLV](http://www.dlvsystem.com/dlv), [clingo](https://potassco.org/clingo) and [DLV2](https://www.mat.unical.it/DLV2) and the _PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language)_ cloud solver [Solver.Planning.Domains](http://solver.planning.domains) (SPD) on the Desktop platform and of DLV and SPD on the Mobile (Androidâ„¢) one (available only for the Java version).

However, the framework has been designed to be easily extensible and adaptable to different solvers and platforms. It is worth to notice that solvers are invoked in different modes; for instance, SPD is invoked via a remote connection, while for the other, binaries are effectively embedded and natively executed.
